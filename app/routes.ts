/**
 * Application Routes Configuration
 * 
 * This file defines all routes for the application using React Router's
 * file-based routing system. Routes are organized by feature and access level.
 * 
 * The structure uses layouts for shared UI elements and prefixes for route grouping.
 * This approach creates a hierarchical routing system that's both maintainable and scalable.
